### Your task   

Using the guide on how to create apex mocks test classes, housed in the directory located here @rules/ApexMocksLibrary/guides/ApexMocksGuide.md
create a test class for the #$ARGUMENTS apex class. Make sure the apex test class you create for the #$ARGUMENTS apex class has 100% code coverage and that you create meaningful assertings for every test method you create. Think very hard prior to performing this task and make sure read the Apex Mocks Guide prior to doing anything. Again the Apex Mocks Guide is located here @rules/ApexMocksLibrary/guides/ApexMocksGuide.md make sure to read it prior to performing this task.
