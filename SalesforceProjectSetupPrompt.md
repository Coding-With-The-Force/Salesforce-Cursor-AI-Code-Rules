Please do the following things in order:

1) Setup this folder to match a Salesforce sfdx project using the "sf project generate" Salesforce cli command and make sure to add a manifest file to the project. Name the project "TempDirectory". If you believe there was an error creating the project or its manifest file please check with me before attempting to create them again.

2) After the project is created, move all files from the "TempDirectory" directory to its parent directory and delete the "TempDirectory" directory. If you believe you have failed moving files or deleting the directory please check with me first before attempting to move the files or delete the directory again.

3) Set my default org for this Salesforce project to the Default Dev Hub in the Salesforce CLI. If you believe you have failed to set the default org for this project, please check with me first prior to attempting to set it again.

4) Pull all metadata from my org into this project that is specified in the package.xml file. If you believe the metadata retrieval has failed stop and ask me first before attempting to retrieve the metadata again.
